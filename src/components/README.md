This is the README.md for the new file called My_NameInputs.tsx
The most updated version is on a new branch called week3-assignmnet-KaylaTrogdon

My approach to this section for Week 3 was to understand not only thenew information on event handling, conditon inputs and styling, and review boolean state associating with inputting the Math class. But I also wanted to make the wepage look clean and put together with all the changes running smoothly. 

Within the program I created: 
-- added a increment and decrement counter with a button to reset the count    only 
-- a NameInput (handling_NameSubmit())
-- a Email Input (handling_EmailSubmit())
-- showed error messages if either email or name input is invalid
-- showed a greeting message for both email and name input
-- created a reset all button that's everything on the screen back to it's default action
-- created a show character count as the user types in their name
-- add a progression simulator to the top of the "Week 3 Progression" section
