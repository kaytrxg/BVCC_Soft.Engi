# 🔍 Bug Hunting Worksheet - Quality Detective Challenge


## Your Detective Team: _______________

---

## 🎯 Mission
Find and document all 5 bugs in the BrokenDemo component at `/broken-demo`—including a UI/UX bug where the button to redisplay the chart is missing.

---

## 📋 Systematic Debugging Process


### Step 1: Visual Inspection (2 minutes)
Look at the UI WITHOUT clicking anything yet.
- What do you notice about the button text?
- Does anything look "off" visually?
- Are there any obvious UI inconsistencies?
- Is any button missing or inaccessible?

**Your observations:**
```

```

### Step 2: User Interaction Testing (3 minutes)
Now interact with the component. Test everything!
- Click "Show Chart" - what happens?
- Click "Use Empty Data" - what happens?
- Try different sequences of button clicks
- Does the button text match what it does?
- After hiding the chart, can you redisplay it? Is the button visible?

**What broke? Document each issue:**

**Bug #1:**
- What happened: _______________
- Expected behavior: _______________
- Actual behavior: _______________

**Bug #2:**
- What happened: _______________
- Expected behavior: _______________
- Actual behavior: _______________

### Step 3: Console Investigation (3 minutes)

**Console findings:**
Find and document all 5 bugs in the BrokenDemo component at `pages/broken-demo` (Visual, Runtime, Logic, Edge Case, and UI/UX)

| Bug # | Line # | Type | What's Wrong | Your Proposed Fix |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1     |        | Visual / Logic / Runtime / Edge Case / UI/UX |              |                   |
| 2     |        | Visual / Logic / Runtime / Edge Case / UI/UX |              |                   |
| 3     |        | Visual / Logic / Runtime / Edge Case / UI/UX |              |                   |
| 4     |        | Visual / Logic / Runtime / Edge Case / UI/UX |              |                   |
| 5     |        | Visual / Logic / Runtime / Edge Case / UI/UX |              |                   |
 Open Chrome DevTools (F12) and check the Console tab.
 - Are there any error messages or warnings? (Note: The BrokenDemo component does not produce console logs, but always check for errors as part of systematic debugging.)
 - What line numbers are mentioned, if any?
 - What does the error message tell you?

 **Console findings:**
 If you do not see any console logs or errors, note that as part of your investigation. Not all bugs will produce console output, but checking is a key QA habit.
