# Week 8 Assignment: Make It Yours & Polish Like a Pro

## Goal
Take your React project to the next level by adding polish and making it truly your own. Focus on four key areas: error handling, loading experience, performance, and accessibility.

## What to Do
1. **Personalize:**
	- Change the look, add features, or integrate something you care about. Make your app unique!

2. **Add Professional Patterns:**
	- **Error Handling:** Use an ErrorBoundary to catch and display errors gracefully.
	- **Loading States:** Show a skeleton loader or spinner while data loads.
	- **Performance:** Use React.memo or useMemo to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Show a render count to prove it works.
	- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and ensure keyboard navigation works everywhere.

## How to Turn It In
- Your code should clearly show all four patterns above.
- Add a short comment or README explaining what you customized and how you met each requirement.
- Commit your work to `week8/ASSIGNMENT.md` and be ready to demo in class.

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Add unit tests for your error boundary or performance logic.
- Use React.lazy and Suspense for code splitting.
